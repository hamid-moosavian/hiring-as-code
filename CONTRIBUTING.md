# Contributing to Hiring as Code

Thank you for your interest in improving the Hiring as Code framework.  
This project is intentionally simple in its early versions. v0.1 is a foundation.  
Thoughtful contributions are welcome.

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Improve or Expand the Framework
If you have:
- A clearer explanation
- A practical example from real teams
- A refinement of one of the seven pillars
- A missing edge case or caveat

Feel free to open an issue describing the proposal.

### 2. Add Examples or Templates
Useful additions include:
- Role specification samples (`/specs`)
- Interview pipeline examples (`/pipeline`)
- Evaluation rubrics or question banks (`/tests`)
- Onboarding checklists (`/deploy`)
- Metrics dashboards (`/monitoring`)

### 3. Propose New Concepts (v0.2+)
The framework will evolve. You may propose:
- New pillars
- Expanded patterns
- Visual diagrams
- Integrations with engineering practices

Please open an issue first so we can discuss scope and fit.

### 4. Share Case Studies
Have you used this framework successfully? We would love to feature your story.

Reach out via GitHub issue or LinkedIn message to [Hamid Moosavian](https://linkedin.com/in/hamidmoosavian).

## What We Are Looking For (v0.1)

Contributions we want:
- Real world examples from teams using the framework
- Clarity improvements to existing pillars
- Practical templates and tools
- Stories about what worked and what did not

Not ready for yet:
- New pillars (let v0.1 stabilize first)
- Major restructuring
- Theoretical additions

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Keep PRs focused.  
   Small, clear changes are easier to review.

2. Provide context.  
   Explain why the change improves the framework.

3. Maintain the tone.  
   Direct, practical, engineering-oriented writing.

4. No company confidential information.  
   Examples should be anonymized or generic.

## Code of Conduct
Be constructive.  
This project is for engineering leaders trying to build better hiring systems.  
Respect and clarity are expected.
